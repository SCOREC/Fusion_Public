"gyro" is a variant of D-g096333.03337 in the repository.

For the "gyro", I made below changes in the "xgc_mesh_in". Mainly, inter-curve
spacing is intended to use gyro radius unit. "inter_curve_spacing 1.0" means 1
gyro-radius size is used for inter curve spacing. Since gyro-radius depends on
local temperature, "eq_tempi_shape -1" (-1 means profile from an external file)
and "eq_tempi_file" provides the file name for the temperature.

Based on inter-curve spacing, intra_curve_spacing also should be modified since
large intra_curve_spacing sometimes causes crash when model face is defined
especially near axis where only few points define concentric circles and model
faces may overlap with each other.

"fluxC_in_privateR_on 1" turns on generating flux curves in private region. You
can turn it on/off in the demonstration.

"inter_curve_spacing_axis_forcing" is an option to force to put a flux curve
in the specified radial position. That is rarely used, and I turned it off by
default.
