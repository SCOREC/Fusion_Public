!Number of 2D planes around the torus, used in spacing points on a curve.

!Tolerance for the gradient of psi
!Effects how exactly the critical points (mins, x-point) are found
tolerance_psi_deriv 1E-10

!Tolerance for psi
!All points on a psi surface are guaranteed to be within this range of the target psi value.
tolerance_psi 1E-8

!Tolerance in meters
!Used in checking if a point is on the boundary, or if it is a duplicate of another point.
tolerance_meters 5E-10

!This value is used to prevent the same critical point from being detected twice.
!If two of the same type of critical point are within this distance, one will be ignored.

!The inverse of this value gives the number of steps used to search in parametric space on the outer grid boundary.

!This is the change in phi of each rk4 step taken when moving a point along a psi curve.

!This is a maximum step size added to Newton's method to deal with extremely small derivatives near critical points.

!If possible, point spacing on a curve will fall within this fraction of the desired value.
spacing_tolerance_optimal 0.9
% spacing_tolerance_optimal 0.5

!Point spacing on a curve will always be within this fraction of the desired value.
!The acceptable range is calculated as 1/(1+tol) to (1+tol) so a value of 1.0 gives a range of .5 to 2.0 times the desired spacing.

!If the dot product between a curve's direction and the wal direction is greater than
!this value, the curve may be cut off as it approaches too close to the edge.
