"coarse" is from one of actual meshing request from Robert. The characteristics
of the input is to use external files not only for inter-curve spacing but also
for intra-curve spacing.

You can see options to use external file "radial_uniform_meshing_unit -1" and
"intra_curve_spacing_option -2" for inter- and intra, respectively. Also file
names are denoted in "inter_curve_spacing_file" and "intra_curve_spacing_file".
